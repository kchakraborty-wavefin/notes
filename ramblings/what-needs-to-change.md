for the internet to be a place with a lack of bias, we need to move away from ads modeled incentives for businesses

the moment ads become part of the ecosystem, we are no longer focusing on providing value to the end user, but instead, focusing on filling pockets, which essentially puts a quicker expiry date on the project overall. 

Google search, for instance, is dying due to a lack of a user focused model. This is somewhere Reddit shines and allows the user to index through content that is raw (for the most part, minus the echo chambers within subreddits).

When you are searching for what movie to watch next, you no longer trust google, becaue it gives you the same default result - the most SEO optimized and ad ridden experience. Whereas, Reddit provides a nice intertwined ad system layered within posts. It's unobtrusive, and gives the user an illusion of control as it becomes more their choice to click into the ads out of their own volition (these ads are blended in as posts too, for maximum effect).

Anything and everything with ads eventually has an expiry date, and for now, major corps think the only other way to win is to sell user data to, you guessed it, ad companies.

Brave browser is another good example of incorporating ads, if we _need_ to go that route. It becomes a game of who makes the best sponsered section transition a la YouTube style. The more engaged (screen time) we can keep the user through these ads, the more both parties win. 

The other reason this doesn't work is because people no longer want just *blatant* ads either. Keyword, blatant. Ads were _perhaps, maybe? idk_ cool at some point during their initiation, but it's an absolute incovenience within the user flow due to the motivations of ad companies (click based revenue) and more importantly blatantness of their message. 

In general, the downward trend for ads is nothing new, Tikok has been an excellent example as a case study for building trust based fan following, and revenue stream for many companies at this point, and all through the means of influencer marketing. These influencers aren't just reviewing entire platforms or products, but are innovating and doing away with the blatantness that the old age ads system relied on. 

If organizations can somehow run ads, while said ads are not just blatantly promoting a product, but also providing value to the user in that said 15-30 second slot, then it's a win-win. However, this model is not feasible for all companies, with their respective user flows given most ads break away attention from the main utility factor. 

Idea: tiktok style ads, or ads in general which not only demonstrate a product, but quickly demonstrate value directly linked with business? If the end goal for ad agencies is to get the user to actually watch the ad, wouldn't it be about time they actually put effort into making these ads instead of slapping a generic image and those :star::star::star:'s that make any review look like it's from the 00s era.
