Shipping containers - I have no idea what's in there - all we need to know is that they meet a spec, and that they match with the orchestrator 

Docker solves the problem of the shipping containers

So what do we do with all these containers once they are built out? Orchestrate!

2000 containers per cluster backed by AWS ECS (container service)

Wave wants to be the port of Shanghai - significantly more than 2000 containers - Kubernetes will take us there!
