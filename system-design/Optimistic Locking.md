- is a concurrency control method for DB systems
- before the DB commit, each transaction verifies that no other transaction has modified the data it has read
- if check reveals modifications â†’ committing transaction rolls-back, and restarts
- phases:
	- begin: record a timestamp marking transaction begin ([sequential integer works too](https://github.com/waveaccounting/payroll/blob/main/db/schema.rb#L306)
	- modify: read db values, tentatively write changes
	- validate: check whether other transactions have modified data that this transaction has used (read/written). This includes other transactions which completed after this transactions start time, and optionally transactions that are active at validation time
	- commit/rollback: if no conflict, commit. If conflict, resolve it using a resolution schema or abort it. Be careful to avoid time-of-check to time-of-use race conditions (TOCTOU)
